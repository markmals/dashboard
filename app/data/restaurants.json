            "description": "New Haven-style pizza has made its way to Dallas. Head to this spot in Garland to try this thin crust, coal-fired pie. The clam pie, a New England favorite, is already earning raves, as are the meatballs and cannoli. Its potato and prosciutto pie is an instant classic.",

Start with the xôi goi du thįt heo (papaya salad served with sticky rice and pork jowl) then dive into a bowl of bó kho (Vietnamese beef stew served with a choice of baguette, rice, rice or egg noodles), or a plate of bánh ťâm bì (thick rice noodles topped with a coconut cream sauce.)",

Folks on the Jake’s side of the fence maybe don’t care about drive-ins, and prefer their burgers smothered in Thousand Island Dressing. The lettuce and tomatoes are always fresh, and all that dressing makes it a salad with a hamburger — right? Kinda? Anyway, it’s good.",
