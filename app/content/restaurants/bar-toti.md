I recently had the pleasure of visiting Bar Toti, which opened on Este’s grounds last month. My girlfriend and I shared the marinated olives, escargot, mussels, and fries and sipped on a mezcal margarita, paloma, sherry cobbler, tinto verano, and porto tonico. Everything was so good that we had to try more and more. The crown jewel here though is that hamburguesa. It’s made with a sesame seed bun, griddled ham, white American cheese, chipotle mayo, and a tart umami-packing escabeche relish that makes this one of the more unique sandwiches you’ll have the pleasure of eating in Austin.
