Great pastrami and corned beef adorn several hefty sandwiches at the Heritage neighborhood deli. Go for a classic or indulge in the Rowdy Roddy turkey melt with cherry peppers. The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 2 p.m. Sunday. Takeout and delivery orders can be placed online, and there are indoor dine-in areas.
