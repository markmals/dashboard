Pedrosoâ€™s serves various-styled pizza pies, including its popular New York-style pie, as well as its Trenton tomato pie (aka New Jersey-style with no cheese), square pies like grandma-style and Sicilian with thicker crusts, and American-style (lots of cheese and sauce with a thicker-than-New York-style crust). Then there are also stombolis, calzones, and sub sandwiches.
