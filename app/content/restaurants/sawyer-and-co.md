All-day diner breakfast can be found at New Orleans-leaning Govalle restaurant. There are breakfast plates, omelets, tacos, burritos, scrambles, and more. With a focus on Southern comfort food like fried chicken biscuits, New Orleans-style French toast, and Creole shrimp and grits, thereâ€™s also a great patio for sunny brunches. Takeout orders can be placed online; there are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
