From the team behind East Austin restaurant Suerte, this seafood-focused Cherrywood dining establishment is dishing up coastal Mexican fare, including aguachiles, ceviches, grilled shrimp, whole fish, and more. Do not skip the super crunchy peccadillos taco. Bonus: oysters are half off during happy hour Sunday through Thursday 5 to 6 p.m., with $25 off seafood platters and towers. There are indoor and outdoor dine-in services
