The North Shoal Creek restaurant gives classic American food — burgers, sandwiches, grilled fish, amazing marinated steak, etc. — the attention it deserves in an upscale but casual setting that is great for dinner with family and friends. Takeout orders can be placed online; there are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
