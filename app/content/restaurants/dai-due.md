The Cherrywood New Texan restaurant — which is so regionally minded that even beer and wine are exclusively from the state — is equally satisfying for brunch or a blow-out meat fest at dinner. The restaurant version of this former farmers’ market stand/supper club from chef Jesse Griffiths is everything Austin could have hoped for. He even won a James Beard book award for his tome about wild hogs. The Texas-forever menu has heavier dishes like giant rib-eyes, fried chicken, and wild boar confit, as well as lighter fare, like mixed green salads and grilled marinated carrots. Takeout orders can be placed online. There are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
