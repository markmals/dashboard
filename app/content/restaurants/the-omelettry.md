Old-fashioned service and gargantuan breakfast plates have made the North Loop restaurant an Austin icon (It’s also arguably one of the city’s original diners: owner Kenny Carpenter was previously business partners with the owners of Magnolia Cafe and Kerbey Lane Cafe). Of course try the omelets, but the lunch plates are also a great deal. Takeout orders can be placed online or over the phone; there are indoor dine-in services.
