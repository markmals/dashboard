Chef Mo Pittle’s Austin restaurant realm continues to grow with the opening of his latest venture. This time, it’s a Mexican-border-Austin-El Paso-styled diner within West Campus dive bar Hole in the Wall as of April. There are tiny tacos with picadillo or Mexican-style potatoes (or both!), its signature sliders, and loads of burritos. Takeout orders can be placed online; there are indoor and outdoor dine-in areas.
