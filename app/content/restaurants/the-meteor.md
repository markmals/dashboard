A great vegetarian option is always meatless pizza. The Meteor has a handful of options including the Mediterraneanish with red sauce, mozzarella, kalamata olives, artichokes, feta, onions, and oregano. At this South Congress cafe and bar with a great natural wine selection you can also order a meatless burger or a sandwich with falafel and tahini slaw. Order can be placed online. There are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
