Chef Ling Qi Wu has grown into a bonafide restaurateur with multiple restaurants and more to come around the city. And it is through this somewhat casual Clarksville restaurant — her first — that diners can get a taste. of what she does best: simple yet high-quality Chinese and pan-Asian dishes, from her iconic soup dumplings to Hakka eggplants to salt-and-pepper lobster tails.
