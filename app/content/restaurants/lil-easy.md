The team behind Sawyer & Co. and De Nada grew with this new Louisianan Cajun restaurant in Govalle in May. This means homey fried seafood baskets, po’ boys, and daily specials like gumbo and red beans/rice/andouille sausage. And naturally, there are NOLA-ish cocktails like draft hurricanes and daiquiris. There are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
