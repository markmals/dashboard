The East Austin Caribbean restaurant, named Eater Austin’s best restaurant of 2022, pays tribute to executive chef Tavel Bristol-Joseph’s Guyanese roots with dishes like buttery roti, wild boar pepper pot, and jerk chicken. Since it’s a Bristol-Joseph project, don’t overlook the desserts, especially the tres leches cake. The restaurant has an upscale tropical vibe, with fruity but balanced cocktails, a large bar, and a small outdoor patio. There are indoor and outdoor dine-in services.
