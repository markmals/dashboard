The North Austin Chinese restaurant has lots of dumplings and hand-made noodles. The extensive dumpling list makes it difficult to decide which one to order, from pork and chive to pan-fried beef and carrot. But lucky, there’s a mix-and-mach option. Bonus: Julie’s offered bags of 50 frozen dumplings too. Takeout orders can be placed online; there are indoor dine-in services.
