The funky little taqueria, from co-owners chef Edgar Rico (who is James Beard Awards’s emerging chef of 2022) and Sara Mardanbigi, has quickly become a taco darling for good reason. Rico works magic into every single one of the East Austin spot’s new-school tacos and tostadas. While the meatier items are terrific, the vegetarian options really showcase his inventive skills: the beet tartare is a pure work of art. The multiple patios are optimal for spreading out, and there is a natural wine list worth exploring. Curbside pickup orders are placed online. There are outdoor dine-in services.
