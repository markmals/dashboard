Pecans are a favorite Southern source of protein for Maricela Vega, the chef at Atlanta restaurant 8ARM and founder of Chicomec√≥atl, an organization centering the foodways of Indigenous Mexican diaspora. Growing up, she would eat them straight-up raw or lightly toasted, but this is her go-to preparation now: sweet, salty, and coated with freshly ground spices. Eat them by the fistful or sprinkle them liberally on salads or grilled veggies for deep flavor and crunch.
