All the flavors of a samosa with none of the deep-frying. A cheesy, spiced potato filling folded into whole wheat tortillas is the best double-carb mashup. Freshly fried, plucked from a grocery store steam table, or baked from frozen, a samosa is a thing of joy. With spiced potatoes ensconced in crisp pastry, what’s not to love? These quesadillas translate the flavor of the triangular treat into a weeknight-friendly dinner—with no deep-frying involved. Crisped in a modest amount of oil, whole wheat tortillas take on an almost-fried aura. The fistful of cheese stuffed inside each quesadilla doesn’t hurt either.
