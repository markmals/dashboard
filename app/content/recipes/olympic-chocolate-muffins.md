Inspired by the Olympic chocolate muffins that went viral during the 2024 summer games in Paris, these dark chocolate muffins (OK, cakes) are delicate and moist and, in their richest form, filled with a fudgy sauce. After Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer competing in the games, raved about the treats from the Olympic Village cafeteria in a series of TikTok videos, he became known as the “muffin man” and spawned other TikTok reels from Olympians taste-testing them and from bakers trying to recreate the muffins at home.
