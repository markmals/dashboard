Fried eggplant can be tricky to get right, and tips and tricks abound that promise both luscious, creamy flesh and crispy skin (salting, pressing, soaking in milk—just to name a few!). Here you achieve that balanced result without any unnecessary fussing.

In a pot of hot oil, the breaded eggplant fries quickly, turning brown and crunchy on the outside and becoming completely tender within.
