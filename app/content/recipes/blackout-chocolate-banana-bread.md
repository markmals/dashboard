This chocolate banana bread recipe mashes up everything you love about the classic version with the rich, moist crumb of a chocolaty blackout cake. What began as chocolate banana bread “turned into blackout cake,” said former staffer Molly Baz of this recipe, when she “decided to double down and use both cocoa powder and chopped chocolate.” When a dash of whole wheat flour made its way into the mix, the recipe strayed even further from BA’s Best Banana Bread. The addition was not an attempt at health, mind you. Instead, Molly says, “It brings out the nuttiness of the chocolate.”
