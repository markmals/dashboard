Spring screams for speedy suppers, and this quick pasta dinner is just the ticket. Although pasta primavera is Italian in notion and New York City in pedigree, itâ€™s the perfect vehicle for fresh Southern vegetables. Here, we've recruited tender spears of asparagus, petite green peas, and sweet-tart cherry tomatoes, but you can toss in any spring vegetable you like, such as baby carrots, snow peas, sugar snaps, or even fresh spinach. We chose bow tie pasta to be fun and festive, but feel free to use anything you have on hand, from elbows to little shells to classic penne.
