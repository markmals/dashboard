A cousin to pimento cheese but without those potentially child-deflecting red peppers, this cream cheese based dip is mild and slightly sweet from a splash of fresh orange juice. Pack it in a lunchbox with celery and crackers for your kids. Or, zip it up with a dash or two of Tabasco and some mashed garlic, spoon it into a bowl surrounded by good potato chips and serve it with cocktails to the adults. It will keep for at least five days in the fridge.
