When fresh basil abounds and you can get a bouquet the size of your head from the farmers market (a.k.a. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year), this basil fried rice recipe should be in your weekly rotation. You can use any variety, including vibrantly hued Thai basil leaves with purple stems, fragrant green Italian basil, or camphorous holy basil, but note that each will give the dish a slightly different flavor.
