Chef Thomas Keller loves to cook with a vegetable at the height of its season, and in this case, two summer vegetables—tomato and fresh zucchini—capture the summer in one dish.In this delicious (and vegan) side dish, Chef Keller roasts zucchini and accompanies the vegetable with an easy recipe for a tangy and savory vierge sauce. You'll know this dish is done when the zucchini are completely tender, rather than when your oven timer goes off.
