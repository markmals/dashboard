Soft, pillowy bread stuffed with melty mozzarella and dipped in a marinara sauce makes for an easy, crowd-pleasing appetizer or side dish. Here, store-bought sauce is doctored up with a few pantry staples, including dried oregano, garlic and red-pepper flakes, but you can use homemade sauce, too. Slice the bread or let everyone tear off pieces, like they would a fresh baguette, for a more spontaneous, cheese-pull moment. To round out the spread with something green, roast broccolini, broccoli or kale on a sheet pan in the oven as the bread cooks, then dip alongside. For a crunchier exterior, unwrap the bread and cook uncovered for the last 5 minutes.
