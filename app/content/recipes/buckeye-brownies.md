Fudgy, cakey, or chewy, studded with nuts or swirled with marshmallow fluff—I love just about every variation of brownie imaginable. One of my favorite riffs on a classic brownie is this buckeye brownie recipe. They’re inspired by Ohio’s favorite candy, the buckeye: a classic treat made with a creamy peanut butter and confectioners' sugar filling that’s rolled and portioned into bite-sized balls, then chilled and partially dipped in chocolate. The treats are called buckeyes because they resemble the nut of the Ohio buckeye tree—the state tree of Ohio. (And the tree nuts, which, by the way, are poisonous, are so named because they resemble a deer's eye.) Buckeye candies are purposefully jaw-clenchingly sweet, rich, and SO good that we feel their flavor combination shouldn’t be limited to just candy.
