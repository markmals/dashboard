These Barbecue Jackfruit Sandwiches are great for a Meatless Monday dinner. The jackfruit tastes and feels just like real meat, so most people won't realize they're eating a plant, not pork. Seared until browned and crispy, then seasoned with smoked paprika, garlic powder, and brown sugar, jackfruit might not be traditional barbecue, but itâ€™s pretty darn tasty when prepared this way.
