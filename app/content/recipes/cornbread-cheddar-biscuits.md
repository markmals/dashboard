Buttermilk biscuits meet cornbread in this decadent crossover your holiday table didnâ€™t know it needed. These will lure you in with the body and flakiness of a tender, buttery biscuit while incorporating the sweet goodness of cornbread. A generous addition of sharp cheddar keeps things cheesy, and fresh, woodsy sage places these biscuits squarely in the holiday season. Gently rolling and stacking the dough block pieces on top of one another will ensure those lofty layers, so be patient with the process. Brush the tops with buttermilk and plenty of flaky salt before sending them into the oven.
