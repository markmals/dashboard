The only thing better than a ball of mozzarella? Many tiny balls of mozzarella. Better still? Tiny marinated mozzarella balls combined with sweet pickled peppers. A garlicky brine of red wine vinegar, chile flakes, and fresh thyme adds heaps of flavor to this perfect party snack. We call for perlini here, but you could use ciliegine mozzarella (i.e., cherry-size); bocconcini will be too large. The longer the fresh mozzarella balls sit in the piquant marinade, the more flavorful they become. That means go ahead and make this antipasto ahead of time (up to two days in advance, refrigerate it in an airtight container) and let it hang out on the counter at room temperature for the duration of the party.
