The perfect union of two of America’s most popular desserts, brownies and cookies, this recipe offers all the goodness of a brownie and bakes up in a fraction of the time. A blend of chopped chocolate, unsweetened cocoa and espresso powder lends enormous depth to the base of these cookies. The only time-intensive step in this recipe is beating the eggs and sugar, but don’t skimp on that process, as it helps the cookies rise without any baking soda or baking powder, giving them structure and shine. Banging the sheet pan on the counter 8 minutes into the baking process creates fudgy cookies and helps create that hallmark cragged surface atop a tray of brownies. Whether you’re the type of person who races to get a corner brownie or you patiently await a middle piece, these chewy brownie cookies offer all of the best textures a brownie has to offer.
