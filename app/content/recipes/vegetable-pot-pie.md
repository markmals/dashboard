Imagine the pot pie of your childhood. Supremely flaky and buttery with a creamy, warm interior, this dish was the underrated star of the weeknight dinner table. Our Test Kitchen professionals sought to develop a pot pie recipe that channeled that comforting, nostalgic feeling, with a fresh, springy twist. The final product? A rich, but still light pot pie that makes the most of fresh spring vegetables. That's right: You won't find any chicken in our Creamy Vegetable Pot Pie. Trust us when we say that you won't even miss the meat.
