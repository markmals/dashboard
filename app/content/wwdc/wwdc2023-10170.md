It's all about the task tree: Find out how structured concurrency can help your apps manage automatic task cancellation, task priority propagation, and useful task-local value patterns. Learn how to manage resources in your app with useful patterns and the latest task group APIs. We'll show you how you can leverage the power of the task tree and task-local values to gain insight into distributed systems. Before watching, review the basics of Swift Concurrency and structured concurrency by checking out “Swift concurrency: Behind the scenes” and “Explore structured concurrency in Swift” from WWDC21.
