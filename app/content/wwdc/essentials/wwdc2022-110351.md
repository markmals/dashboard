Join us as we explore one of the core concepts in Swift concurrency: isolation of tasks and actors. We'll take you through Swift's approach to eliminating data races and its effect on app architecture. We'll also discuss the importance of atomicity in your code, share the nuances of Sendable checking to maintain isolation, and revisit assumptions about ordering work in a concurrent system.
