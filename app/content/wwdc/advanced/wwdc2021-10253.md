Some problems are easier to solve by creating a customized programming language, or “domain-specific language.” While creating a DSL traditionally requires writing your own compiler, you can instead use result builders with Swift 5.4 to make your code both easier to read and maintain. We'll take you through best practices for designing a custom language for Swift: Learn about result builders and trailing closure arguments, explore modifier-style methods and why they work well, and discover how you can extend Swift's normal language rules to turn Swift into a DSL. To get the most out of this session, it's helpful (though not necessary) to have some experience writing SwiftUI views. You won't need to know anything about parser or compiler implementation.
