Discover Swift concurrency in action: Follow along as we update an existing sample app. Get real-world experience with async/await, actors, and continuations. We'll also explore techniques for migrating existing code to Swift concurrency over time. To get the most out of this code-along, we recommend first watching “Meet async/await in Swift” and “Protect mutable state with Swift actors” from WWDC21. Note: To create an async task in Xcode 13 beta 3 and later, use the Task initializer instead.
