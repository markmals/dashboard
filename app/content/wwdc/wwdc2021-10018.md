There's never been a better time to develop your apps with SwiftUI. Discover the latest updates to the UI framework — including lists, buttons, and text fields — and learn how these features can help you more fully adopt SwiftUI in your app. Find out how to create beautiful, visually-rich graphics using the canvas view, materials, and enhancements to symbols. Explore multi-column tables on macOS, refinements to focus and keyboard interaction, and the multi-platform search API. And we'll show you how to take advantage of features like Swift concurrency, a brand new `AttributedString`, format styles, localization, and so much more.
