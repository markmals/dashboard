Join us for an update on Swift. We'll briefly go through a history of Swift over the past decade, and show you how the community has grown through workgroups, expanded the package ecosystem, and increased platform support. We'll introduce you to a new language mode that achieves data-race safety by default, and a language subset that lets you run Swift on highly constrained systems. We'll also explore some language updates including noncopyable types, typed throws, and improved C++ interoperability.
